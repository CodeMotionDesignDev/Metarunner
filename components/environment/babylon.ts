/**
 * BABYLON.JS IMPORT PROXY =====================================================
 * @note: Comment out imports that you do not need to reduce production bundle size.
 * @reference: https://forum.babylonjs.com/t/es6-tree-shaking-build-large-bundle-size/21084
 * @see: https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/es6_support#tree-shaking
 *  - Importing components directly reduces bundle size and compile time.
 *    => at the moment of writing, optimisation yielded 355 KB gzipped bundle.
 *  - babylonjs/core library adds 741 KB gzipped to total bundle size.
 * =============================================================================
